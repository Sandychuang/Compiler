# Compiler
A compiler, including lex analyser, LALR(1) parser and the parser generator. 
They are used for compiling a script program language specified by me. Its IR is a symtax tree and currently is interpreted to run. But after i build the virtual machine, the IR will be compiled to asm language or byte-code to run in it.
